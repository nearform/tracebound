# Tracebound

![Tracebound](public/hero.png)

**Tracebound closes the loop between your LLM agent in production and the next fix you ship.**

## The problem

Teams ship LLM agents and then operate them blind. Telemetry is collected but rarely closed back into the development loop. Failure modes get discovered ad-hoc, usually by one engineer scrolling Langfuse on a Friday afternoon. Fixes are one-off, and rarely regression-tested against the trace that motivated them. Expensive SME review effort gets thrown away after a single Slack comment.

## What Tracebound does

Tracebound ingests production traces from any telemetry source, harvests feedback from users and subject-matter experts, and clusters recurring failures into a persistent, versioned catalogue that lives as a diffable file in your repo. For every failure mode, a coding agent drafts a fix spec you review *before* code is touched, implements the change in your working tree, and replays the original failing cohort against the patched agent to confirm the fix actually worked. Every state transition is human-reviewed; nothing gets committed, pushed, or merged without you.

```
ingest traces → extract feedback → cluster failure modes → propose fix → verify → (optionally) harden
```

Tracebound is opinionated about the *workflow* and agnostic about the telemetry source, feedback signal, agent framework, and test infrastructure.

---

## How it works

Tracebound has two parts:

- **A CLI** — deterministic primitives: scaffold, validate, query. Stateless, fast, used as a subroutine by the skills and by you.
- **Agent skills** — LLM-driven judgment work. Each skill is a `.md` file that an AI coding agent (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude) reads and follows. Skills call the CLI as a subroutine.

Everything lives as diffable files in your repo under a `tracebound/` folder. No server, no database.

---
## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @nearform/tracebound
```

Or use without installing:

```bash
npx @nearform/tracebound <command>
```

After installing, run this inside the project that contains your agent to copy
the bundled skills (`analyze-traces`, `create-adapter`, `research-failure-mode`,
`implement-failure-mode`) into that project's skills directory:

```bash
tracebound install-skills
```

By default, the command writes to `.claude/skills/tracebound/`. It is idempotent
— re-running it reports already-installed skills as up-to-date and never
overwrites a skill you have edited locally unless you pass `--force`. The CLI
also runs `install-skills` from its `postinstall` hook as a best-effort default
when your `cwd` at install time is the target project.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Scaffold your project

Run this inside the repo that contains your agent. Pick a name for the agent — Tracebound scopes everything by it, so a single repo can track multiple agents side by side:

```bash
tracebound init support-bot
```

This creates:

```
tracebound/
└── support-bot/
    ├── tracebound.config.md      # edit this first
    ├── failure_modes.json       # starts empty
    ├── traces/                  # drop JSONL files here
    ├── failure_modes/           # one folder per failure mode
    └── adapters/                # converter scripts go here
```

Run `tracebound init <other-agent>` again to track a second agent. List the configured agents at any time with `tracebound agents`.

### 2. Configure the project

Edit `tracebound/support-bot/tracebound.config.md`. At minimum fill in:

- **Agent under test** — repo root, entry point, framework.
- **Sanity checks** — `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, or whatever your project uses.
- **Verify the fix** — use the unified section to document the targeted trace replay command (consuming the failure-mode cohort `input` values), the eval suite(s) to run after replay, and the sanity-check commands to fall back on. `implement-failure-mode` reads this in priority order.
- **Hard rules** — constraints the coding agent must never violate (e.g. "never edit `src/payments/**` without human review").

### 3. Import traces

Write or generate an adapter script under `tracebound/support-bot/adapters/` that reads your telemetry provider's export and writes Tracebound-format JSONL to `tracebound/support-bot/traces/`.

The `create-adapter` skill can generate this script from a sample of your data:

> "Create a Tracebound adapter for this Langfuse JSON export: `<paste sample>`"

Each line in the output JSONL is a **Trace**:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "trc_abc123",
  "input": "Can you cancel my order?",
  "output": "I've cancelled order #5551. You'll get a confirmation email shortly.",
  "feedback": [{ "sentiment": "negative", "source": "sme", "comment": "No cancel tool exists — hallucinated side-effect." }],
  "originalTraceFile": "original/trc_abc123.json",
  "failureModeIds": [],
  "analysis": { "status": "pending" }
}
```

### 4. Discover failure modes

Point the `analyze-traces` skill at a trace file (always under one agent):

> "Run analyze-traces for support-bot on `tracebound/support-bot/traces/langfuse-2026-04-26.jsonl`"

The skill processes negatively-signalled traces in configurable batches, clusters them into failure modes, writes `failure_modes.json`, and validates after every batch. It self-corrects on validation errors.

```jsonc
// failure_modes.json
{
  "failureModes": [
    {
      "id": "fm_2026_04_hallucinated_action",
      "title": "Hallucinated side-effect confirmations",
      "description": "Agent confirms destructive actions (cancellations, refunds) it has no tool to perform.",
      "status": "discovered",
      "severity": "high",
      "tags": ["hallucination", "tool-use"],
      "discoveredAt": "2026-04-26T14:30:00Z",
      "lastUpdated": "2026-04-26T14:30:00Z",
      "affectedTraces": [{ "filename": "langfuse-2026-04-26.jsonl", "traceId": "trc_abc123" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Research and spec a fix

Hand an agent and a failure mode id to the `research-failure-mode` skill:

> "Research fm_2026_04_hallucinated_action for support-bot"

The skill reads the cohort, reads the agent source, forms hypotheses, then writes `tracebound/support-bot/failure_modes/fm_2026_04_hallucinated_action/SPEC.md` — a structured fix spec with root cause, proposed changes, acceptance criteria, and a test plan.

**You review the spec before any code is touched.** When you're happy, tell the skill to mark it approved (or edit `status` in `failure_modes.json` yourself to `fix_approved`).

### 6. Implement and verify

> "Implement fm_2026_04_hallucinated_action for support-bot"

The `implement-failure-mode` skill reads the approved spec, writes a `PLAN.md`, makes the code changes, runs your sanity checks, then invokes the live agent with inputs derived from the failure mode's cohort to confirm the failure is resolved. Status moves to `verified`.

## CLI reference

```
tracebound <command> [options]

Commands:
  init <agent-name>    Scaffold tracebound/<agent-name>/ in the current repo.
  agents               List the agents configured under tracebound/.
  validate             Validate one agent's tracebound/<agent>/ tree.
  status               Print catalogue health for one agent.
  trace get <id>       Find a trace by id within one agent.
  fm get <id>          Print a failure mode by id within one agent.
  install-skills       Copy bundled skills into the local project's skills directory.

Global options:
  -h, --help           Show this help.
  -v, --version        Print the CLI version.
```

Every command except `init` and `agents` requires `--agent <name>` (alias `-a`). Without it, the command exits 2 and prints the list of agents currently configured under `tracebound/`.

### `tracebound init <agent-name>`

Scaffolds `tracebound/<agent-name>/`. Pre-existing files are left untouched. Agent names must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` (lowercase letters, digits, underscores, hyphens; must start with a letter or digit).

```
Positionals:
  <agent-name>       Required.

Options:
  -C, --cwd <path>   Directory to initialise inside (default: cwd)
```

### `tracebound agents`

Lists every subdirectory of `tracebound/` that contains a `tracebound.config.md` file (sorted alphabetically). Exits 0 even when no agents are configured.

```
Options:
  -C, --cwd <path>   Directory to inspect (default: cwd)
  --json             Emit { "agents": [{ "name", "path" }] }

Exit codes:
  0   listing printed (may be empty)
  2   could not run
```

### `tracebound validate`

Checks structure, schemas, and invariants for one agent:

- Required files and folders exist (`tracebound.config.md`, `failure_modes.json`, `traces/`, `failure_modes/`, `adapters/`).
- `failure_modes.json` parses against the `FailureModesFile` schema.
- Every `traces/*.jsonl` line parses against the `Trace` schema.
- Failure mode ids are unique.
- `affectedTraces[]` entries point to files and trace ids that exist.
- Bidirectional links: every `affectedTraces[n].traceId` has a backlink in `failureModeIds[]`, and vice versa.
- No duplicate `(filename, traceId)` entries within a failure mode.

```
Options:
  -a, --agent <name>   Required.
  -C, --cwd <path>     Directory to validate (default: cwd)
  --json               Emit a structured JSON report

Exit codes:
  0   passed
  1   validation issues found
  2   could not run (IO error, missing or unknown --agent)
```

### `tracebound status`

Prints catalogue health for one agent: failure-mode counts by lifecycle status, recently updated failure modes, specs awaiting approval, and per-file trace counts.

```
Options:
  -a, --agent <name>   Required.
  -C, --cwd <path>     Directory to inspect (default: cwd)
  --json               Emit structured JSON

Exit codes:
  0   report printed
  2   could not run
```

### `tracebound trace get <id>`

Scans all `traces/*.jsonl` files for one agent and prints the first trace whose `id` matches.

```
Options:
  -a, --agent <name>   Required.
  -C, --cwd <path>     Directory to inspect (default: cwd)
  --json               Emit the raw JSON object

Exit codes:
  0   found
  1   not found
  2   could not run
```

### `tracebound fm get <id>`

Looks up a failure mode by id in one agent's `failure_modes.json` and prints it.

```
Options:
  -a, --agent <name>   Required.
  -C, --cwd <path>     Directory to inspect (default: cwd)
  --json               Emit the raw JSON object

Exit codes:
  0   found
  1   not found
  2   could not run
```

### `tracebound install-skills`

Copies every skill bundled with the CLI into the local project's skills
directory. By default the target is `.claude/skills/tracebound/`. Skills that
already exist locally with the same content are reported as up-to-date; skills
you have edited locally are NOT overwritten unless `--force` is passed. When
the CLI is installed in environments that disable `postinstall` (or when you
upgrade), re-run this command to refresh the local copy.

```
Options:
  -C, --cwd <path>     Directory to install skills into (default: cwd)
  -t, --target <dir>   Subdirectory under --cwd (default: .claude/skills/tracebound)
  -f, --force          Overwrite locally-modified skills
      --dry-run        Print what would change, do not write

Exit codes:
  0   success (installed, up-to-date, or self-install skipped)
  2   could not run
```

## Skills reference

Skills are instruction files for your AI coding agent. Drop the `skills/` folder into your agent's context or reference individual files.

Every skill takes the agent name as a required input — pass it explicitly in the trigger phrase (e.g. "for support-bot") or the skill will run `tracebound agents` and ask which one.

| Skill | Trigger phrase | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `analyze-traces` | "Analyze `traces/foo.jsonl` for support-bot" | Clusters negatively-signalled traces into failure modes; writes `failure_modes.json`. |
| `research-failure-mode` | "Research `fm_…` for support-bot" | Investigates root cause, reads source, drafts `SPEC.md`. Read-only against agent code. |
| `implement-failure-mode` | "Implement `fm_…` for support-bot" | Applies an approved spec, runs sanity checks, verifies fix against the live agent. |
| `create-adapter` | "Create an adapter for support-bot from this Langfuse export" | Generates a converter script (per-agent) from a sample of your telemetry data. |

All skills:
- Run `tracebound validate --agent <name>` as a preflight check and refuse to proceed on a broken catalogue.
- Quote the **Hard rules** from `tracebound/<agent>/tracebound.config.md` before doing any work.
- Operate on one agent at a time — they never read or write under another agent's directory.
- Never commit, push, or open PRs — they leave the working tree ready and stop.
